DIY RFID authentication


A simple way to create an rfid authentication System
We just need 
1.NodeMCU
2.mfrc522 (RFID reader)
3.RFID card

Using these conponents we can create an rfid based authentication system.
We would be pulling requests from sql server, so we'll be required to install sql server and apache server.
We should have a database to connect to your nodeMCU through which we are going to autenticate the users.
